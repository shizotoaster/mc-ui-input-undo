## UI Input Undo (Redo)
Updated fork of [TheCSDev's UI Input Undo](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-ui-input-undo)
This is a client-side mod that adds a feature that allows you to undo and redo changes made in textual UI input fields. To undo or redo, simply select the desired input field, write something in it, and then use Ctrl + (Z or Y) to undo and redo the changes that were made. You can also define your own undo/redo keys in the controls options menu.

Sometimes you might make a mistake while typing in the chat or in options or you may accidentally erase the text you wrote. This mod will allow you to undo such mistakes.
